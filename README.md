üëã Hi! Welcome to our interactive design project repository!

The project names "Silent-spring" is inspired by Rachel Carson‚Äôs Silent Spring, explores human impacts on natural environment and conveys messages of sustainability through multisensory interaction. It uses Arduino-driven sensors to simulate human-nature interactions like contact, destruction, and pesticide over-use, making invisible ecological harm physically perceptible via light, sound and touch. The immersive approach design encourages deeper reflection on sustainability, fostering awareness and responsibility to adopt more eco-friendly practices in everyday life.

üí° #Design Concept
Our tangible user interface aims to simulate the interaction between humans and nature, offering an educational experience that highlights the impact of human actions on the environment. This design mirrors Carson‚Äôs observation that the contamination of the world is not because a single event, but a sum of countless small betrayals (Carson, 2023). The cumulative interaction forces users to confront how incremental human actions compound into ecological collapse.
